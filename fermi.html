            <h2>Fundamentals of Fermi Questioning</h2>
            <p>
                Fermi questions are a type of question that can be used to test the validity of a hypothesis. The
                questions
                are named after physicist Enrico Fermi, who used them to test the validity of his theories. The
                questions
                are designed to be answered by a simple "yes" or "no" and are intended to be used in a group setting.
                The
                questions are as follows:

                ask me a fermi question related to business analysis 

How many businesses in the world currently use data analysis to inform their decision making?




Derrian Chia
Assuming that there are 1 billion people in the world and that 10 percent of the population is entrepreneurial in nature. that would make it 100 million businesses that are incorporated in the world. however it seems that not all businesses are digitally inclined and are adverse towards data analysis. lets put it at another 10 percent of people that use data analysis. this brings it down to 10 million businesses. 
That's an interesting observation. Can you estimate the percentage of businesses that are successful in using data analysis to inform their decision-making processes?




Derrian Chia
suppose that 10 million businesses are using data analytics. but not all of them are very adept at using analytics. probably 5 percent are really driven to use analytics to make day to day observations. that brings it down to 500 thousand businesses 
That's an interesting observation. Let me ask you a question related to this: If there are 500 thousand businesses that are really driven to use analytics, what might be some challenges they face in using data effectively to inform their decisions?




Derrian Chia
i would say that since there are 500 thousand businesses these would be hard core , early adopter who have a data first mindset towards data analytics. i believe they would face scrutiny from the fellow businesses who are not an early adopter. they might get discriminated against to do business with them. That would make the social argument of what challenge they are facing. Economically, building data is not cheap. Data collection is a hassle, to be able to set pipelines to have clear and accurate data which are clean is a really difficult process for businesses. many a times resources has to be allocated in order to clean data up to make sense of it. 
Interesting points. Based on your analysis, it seems that there are both social and economic challenges that businesses face when trying to adopt and use data analytics. Could you elaborate further on the economic challenges businesses might face in building and maintaining a data analytics infrastructure? And what are some potential solutions to these challenges?




Derrian Chia
I would think that businesses face the economic costs of maintaining a data analytics from a macro perspective. this may include hiring costs to engage data cleaners to cleanse the data. additionally there has to be resources allocated to have people make sense of the data once collected. this may be data scientist or engineers that are hired. This would form the human capital side of things. apart from that , physical infrastructure may also be important. such as servers or gpus in order for a company to really house datas. they may have to engage a data center to allocate compute resource to this businesses to run effectively. but ultimately i believe that a good solution to this problem would be to drive the marginal cost of compute and the democratisation of data knowledge. firstly lowering the cost of compute to near zero would increase accessibility so that it becomes a basic need that everyone can gain access. democratisation of data knowledge would reduce the salaries of these data professionals. however it would benefit organisations as they have a larger pool of options to choose from and reduce their cost   
That's a great analysis. Now, let me ask you another Fermi question related to this topic: How might the use of data analytics affect job security for employees in traditional business roles?




Derrian Chia
i want you to act as a fermi question coach  review my fermi answers and how i can improve on them. 
Sure, I'd be happy to help you improve your Fermi answers. Please provide me with your previous Fermi answers so I can review them and provide feedback.

Great job on your Fermi answers! Here are a few suggestions for improvement:

When estimating the number of businesses using data analysis, consider gathering data from industry reports or surveys to support your estimate.

When estimating the percentage of businesses successfully using data analysis, consider defining what success means in this context and how it can be measured.

When discussing the challenges businesses face in using data effectively, consider providing specific examples of businesses that have faced these challenges and how they overcame them.

When proposing solutions to these challenges, consider discussing potential drawbacks or limitations of these solutions and how they can be addressed.

Overall, keep in mind that Fermi questions require creative thinking and estimation based on available information, so don't be afraid to take risks and make assumptions in your answers.




Derrian Chia
what is the point of fermi questioning
The point of Fermi questioning is to encourage people to think critically and creatively about complex problems or questions that may not have an easy or straightforward answer. It involves breaking down a problem or question into smaller parts, estimating or making educated guesses about various aspects of the problem, and then using those estimates to arrive at a reasonable answer or solution. The process encourages curiosity, open-mindedness, and flexibility in thinking, and can be useful in a wide range of contexts, including science, business, and everyday life.




Derrian Chia
why would someone want to improve on fermi questioning
There are several reasons why someone might want to improve on their Fermi questioning skills.

Firstly, being able to ask thoughtful and insightful Fermi questions can help to develop critical thinking skills. By asking questions that require estimations and logical reasoning, one can improve their ability to analyze and evaluate information.

Secondly, Fermi questions can be a useful tool in problem-solving and decision-making. They can help to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts and can provide a framework for approaching solutions.

Finally, Fermi questioning can be a useful communication tool. By asking well-crafted questions, one can engage in meaningful discussions and debates, clarify misunderstandings, and promote understanding and learning.

            <h2>History of Bayesian Theorem</h2>
            <p>
                Bayesian theorem is named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, who first formulated the theorem in the 18th
                century. He
                developed the theorem in the context of solving a specific problem in probability theory known as the
                "inverse
                probability problem." However, it was not until after Bayes' death that his work was published by
                Richard Price,
                another prominent mathematician of the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the years that followed, Bayesian theorem gained wider acceptance and was further developed by
                mathematicians
                such as Pierre-Simon Laplace. Over time, the theorem became an essential tool in the field of statistics
                and
                probability, with numerous applications across various disciplines, including science, engineering,
                economics, and
                more recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

            <h2>How Bayesian Theorem Applies to Large Language Models</h2>
            <p>
                Bayesian theorem is an essential component of many machine learning algorithms, including large language
                models
                (LLMs). In the context of LLMs, Bayesian methods can be used to estimate the parameters of the model,
                update
                beliefs about the model's parameters as new data is observed, and make predictions based on the current
                state of
                the model.
            </p>
            <p>
                One common application of Bayesian theorem in LLMs is through the use of Bayesian inference, where the
                model's
                parameters are updated iteratively as new data is processed. This allows the model to learn from the
                data and
                make more accurate predictions over time.

        <section id="backpropagation">
            <h2>How does back propogate and Bayesian Theorem Works Together</h2>
            <p>
                Bayesian theorem and backpropagation are two different ideas, but they can work together in some
                situations.

                Imagine that Bayesian theorem is like a detective who uses clues to guess who might be the criminal.
                Backpropagation is like a teacher who helps a student learn by telling them which answers are right and
                wrong.

                When we have a big computer brain called a neural network, we sometimes want to help it learn using both
                the detective's clues (Bayesian theorem) and the teacher's advice (backpropagation). In some cases, they
                can work together to make the computer brain smarter and better at understanding things.

                What I have understood
            </h1>
            <p>The theorem is written as P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B), where P(A|B) is the probability of event A
                happening,
                given that event B has occurred, P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening, given that event A has
                occurred, and P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of events A and B happening independently.
            </p>
            <p>
                i need to ignore the conditional probability first because i dont know what is that value.
    
            </p>
            <p>
                coin a is 0.5 and coin b is 0.75. but given the coin tosses, it is telling us whether it is heads or tails
            </p>
            <p>
                this means that i have P(T) is actually 5 tosses, 0.25 and P(H) is actually 0.75 probability which is 15 times.
                total times is actually 20 times.
                
                instead of assuming of which coin did i take.
                i want to assume which probability of it is heads and which probability is tails
                P(T)/P(H) = 0.25/0.75 = 0.3333333333333333

                but what is the conditional probability of B given A?
                P(B|A) = ?
                P(B|A) = 0.25*0.75 = 0.1875
                then what about p(A|B)?

                = 0.1875*0.3333333333333333 = 0.0625
                
                so the conditional probability of A given B is 0.0625

                So what can i do with the conditional probability?
