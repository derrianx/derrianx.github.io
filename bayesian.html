            <p>
                Bayesian theorem, also known as Bayes' rule or Bayes' law, is a probabilistic theorem that describes the
                relationship between the conditional probabilities of two events. It is named after Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century
                English statistician and philosopher. The theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics,
                providing a mathematical framework for updating our beliefs when given new evidence.

                The theorem is written as P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B), where P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening,
                given that event B has occurred, P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening, given that event A has
                occurred, and P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of events A and B happening independently.

            <h2>History of Bayesian Theorem</h2>
            <p>
                Bayesian theorem is named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, who first formulated the theorem in the 18th century. He
                developed the theorem in the context of solving a specific problem in probability theory known as the "inverse
                probability problem." However, it was not until after Bayes' death that his work was published by Richard Price,
                another prominent mathematician of the time.

                In the years that followed, Bayesian theorem gained wider acceptance and was further developed by mathematicians
                such as Pierre-Simon Laplace. Over time, the theorem became an essential tool in the field of statistics and
                probability, with numerous applications across various disciplines, including science, engineering, economics, and
                more recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

            <h2>How Bayesian Theorem Applies to Large Language Models</h2>
            <p>
                Bayesian theorem is an essential component of many machine learning algorithms, including large language models
                (LLMs). In the context of LLMs, Bayesian methods can be used to estimate the parameters of the model, update
                beliefs about the model's parameters as new data is observed, and make predictions based on the current state of
                the model.
            </p>
            <p>
                One common application of Bayesian theorem in LLMs is through the use of Bayesian inference, where the model's
                parameters are updated iteratively as new data is processed. This allows the model to learn from the data and
                make more accurate predictions over time.

            <h2>Why Bayesian Theorem Works So Well in Large Language Models</h2>
            <p>
                Bayesian theorem works well in large language models because it provides a principled framework for updating
