            <h2>Fundamentals of Bayesian Theorem</h2>
            <p>
                Bayesian theorem, also known as Bayes' rule or Bayes' law, is a probabilistic theorem that describes the
                relationship between the conditional probabilities of two events. It is named after Thomas Bayes, an
                18th-century
                English statistician and philosopher. The theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and
                statistics,
                providing a mathematical framework for updating our beliefs when given new evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                The theorem is written as P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B), where P(A|B) is the probability of event A
                happening,
                given that event B has occurred, P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening, given that event A has
                occurred, and P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of events A and B happening independently.

            <h2>History of Bayesian Theorem</h2>
            <p>
                Bayesian theorem is named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, who first formulated the theorem in the 18th
                century. He
                developed the theorem in the context of solving a specific problem in probability theory known as the
                "inverse
                probability problem." However, it was not until after Bayes' death that his work was published by
                Richard Price,
                another prominent mathematician of the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the years that followed, Bayesian theorem gained wider acceptance and was further developed by
                mathematicians
                such as Pierre-Simon Laplace. Over time, the theorem became an essential tool in the field of statistics
                and
                probability, with numerous applications across various disciplines, including science, engineering,
                economics, and
                more recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

            <h2>How Bayesian Theorem Applies to Large Language Models</h2>
            <p>
                Bayesian theorem is an essential component of many machine learning algorithms, including large language
                models
                (LLMs). In the context of LLMs, Bayesian methods can be used to estimate the parameters of the model,
                update
                beliefs about the model's parameters as new data is observed, and make predictions based on the current
                state of
                the model.
            </p>
            <p>
                One common application of Bayesian theorem in LLMs is through the use of Bayesian inference, where the
                model's
                parameters are updated iteratively as new data is processed. This allows the model to learn from the
                data and
                make more accurate predictions over time.

        <section id="backpropagation">
            <h2>How does back propogate and Bayesian Theorem Works Together</h2>
            <p>
                Bayesian theorem and backpropagation are two different ideas, but they can work together in some
                situations.

                Imagine that Bayesian theorem is like a detective who uses clues to guess who might be the criminal.
                Backpropagation is like a teacher who helps a student learn by telling them which answers are right and
                wrong.

                When we have a big computer brain called a neural network, we sometimes want to help it learn using both
                the detective's clues (Bayesian theorem) and the teacher's advice (backpropagation). In some cases, they
                can work together to make the computer brain smarter and better at understanding things.
